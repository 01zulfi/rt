# remember this (rt): cli utility to store key value pairs

i use it to store short texts, ids, memos for later use

## how to use

copy `rt` executable file to `/usr/local/bin`. this should make `rt` command available everywhere

it stores key value pairs in a json format at `$HOME/.rt.json`

## commands

- rt a(dd) key ?value    
    if value isn't provided, key is the value

- rt v(iew) ?key
